# Enhanced Kerala Crop Calendar Features

## ✅ What's Now Implemented:

### 🗓️ **Dynamic Date Ranges**
Instead of fixed "1-10, 11-20, 21-30" periods, the system now generates:

- **Adaptive periods** based on current date
- **Variable-length periods** (7-15 days each)
- **Real month lengths** (28, 30, or 31 days)
- **Current-day awareness** - starts from today's date

### 🌧️ **Today's Date: September 23, 2025**
Your weather guidance will now show:
- **Period 1**: "September 23-28" (next 5 days)
- **Period 2**: "September 29-October 6" (following week)
- **Period 3**: "October 7-15" (extended outlook)

### 🎯 **Season-Specific Intelligence**
- **SW Monsoon (Jun-Sep)**: Heavy → Consistent → Tapering
- **NE Monsoon (Oct-Dec)**: Active → Scattered → Clearing
- **Dry Season (Jan-Mar)**: Clear → Hot → Peak Dry
- **Hot Season (Apr-May)**: Hot & Dry → Peak Heat → Pre-monsoon Prep

### 🔄 **Auto-Updates Daily**
Every time you refresh the crop calendar:
- Date ranges automatically adjust to current day
- Weather conditions reflect appropriate timing
- Advice stays relevant to today's farming needs

## 🧪 Test It Now:

1. **Refresh your crop calendar page**
2. **Check "Weather-Based Farming Guidance"** 
3. **Notice the date ranges now start from today (Sep 23)**
4. **Try again tomorrow** - dates will automatically shift forward!

This makes your Kerala crop calendar much more practical and current for real farming decisions! 🌾
